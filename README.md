# RegGeoNet: Learning Regular Representations for Large-Scale 3D Point Clouds

This is the official implementation of **[RegGeoNet](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-022-01682-w) (IJCV 2022)**, an unsupervised neural architecture to parameterize an unstructured 3D point cloud into a regular 2D image representation structure called deep geometry image (**DeepGI**), such that spatial coordinates of unordered 3D points are encoded in three-channel grid pixels.
